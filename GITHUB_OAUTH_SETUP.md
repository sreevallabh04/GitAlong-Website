# GitHub OAuth Implementation - GitAlong Website

## Overview
The GitAlong website has been updated to use GitHub OAuth as the primary (and only) authentication method. This change simplifies the user experience by allowing users to sign in directly with their GitHub accounts, which is perfect for a developer-focused platform.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Updated `.env` file with GitHub OAuth credentials:
  - `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23liqdqoZ88pfzPSnY`
  - `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=c9aee11b9fa27492e73d7a1433e94b9cb7299efe`

### 2. AuthContext Updates
- Removed email/password authentication methods
- Removed Google OAuth integration
- Simplified to only support GitHub OAuth
- Updated interface to only include necessary methods:
  - `loginWithGitHub()`
  - `logout()`
  - `updateUserProfile()`

### 3. AuthModal Redesign
- Removed email/password form
- Removed Google sign-in option
- Simplified to show only GitHub sign-in button
- Updated UI to be more focused and streamlined
- Removed mode switching (login/signup) as GitHub handles this

### 4. Navigation Component Updates
- Simplified auth click handlers
- Removed separate login/signup modes
- Both "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons now open the same modal
- Removed unused parameters from AuthModal

### 5. Landing Page Updates
- Updated to use the simplified AuthModal interface
- Removed auth mode state management

## Firebase Configuration Required

To complete the setup, you'll need to configure GitHub OAuth in your Firebase Console:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
2. Enable GitHub provider
3. Add your OAuth credentials:
   - GitHub OAuth 2.0 Client ID: `Ov23liqdqoZ88pfzPSnY`
   - GitHub OAuth 2.0 Client Secret: `c9aee11b9fa27492e73d7a1433e94b9cb7299efe`
4. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `https://gitalong-c8075.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler`
   - For development: `http://localhost:3000/__/auth/handler`
   - For development: `http://localhost:3001/__/auth/handler`

## GitHub OAuth App Configuration

Make sure your GitHub OAuth App is configured with the correct settings:

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps
2. Find your app with Client ID: `Ov23liqdqoZ88pfzPSnY`
3. Set Authorization callback URL to: `https://gitalong-c8075.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler`
4. For development, you may need to add: `http://localhost:3001/__/auth/handler`

## Benefits of This Change

1. **Simplified UX**: Users only need to remember their GitHub credentials
2. **Developer-focused**: Perfect for a coding collaboration platform
3. **Reduced complexity**: No password management, forgot password flows, etc.
4. **Better security**: Leverages GitHub's robust authentication system
5. **Faster onboarding**: Developers already have GitHub accounts

## Testing

The application is now ready for testing:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the website
3. Click "Sign In" or "Sign Up" - both open the GitHub OAuth modal
4. Click "Continue with GitHub" to authenticate

## Next Steps

1. Configure Firebase Console with GitHub OAuth settings
2. Test the authentication flow
3. Verify user data is properly stored in Firebase
4. Update any user profile pages to work with GitHub user data
